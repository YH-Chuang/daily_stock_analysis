# Repository Instructions

Canonical source: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

If any instruction in this file conflicts with `AGENTS.md`, follow `AGENTS.md`.

## Core Rules

- Respect directory boundaries:
  - Backend: `src/`, `data_provider/`, `api/`, `bot/`
  - Web: `apps/dsa-web/`
  - Desktop: `apps/dsa-desktop/`
  - Deployment/workflows: `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/`, `docker/`
- Inside a task the user has already assigned, you may run `git commit`, `git push`, `gh pr create`, and `gh pr merge` without confirming each one, provided all of these hold: the change stays in that task's scope with no unrelated refactoring; the validation matrix for the touched surface has been run; blocking CI on the current head is green (`ai-governance`, `backend-gate`, `docker-build`, plus `web-gate` for frontend changes); no merge blocker from `AGENTS.md` section 8 applies; and you report the outcome honestly, including unverified items and risks.
- These still require explicit user confirmation: `git tag` and publishing releases; force pushing to `main` or someone else's branch; `git reset --hard`, `git rebase`, `git stash`, or anything else that overwrites pushed commits or uncommitted local changes; deleting someone else's branch; and changing the triggers, permission boundaries, or release flow in `.github/workflows/**`.
- Autonomy does not lower the bar. If validation is thin, CI has not passed, or the PR description contradicts the actual diff, stop and explain rather than merging first and patching after.
- Before creating/updating PRs, PR review, or issue analysis, refresh the latest code baseline with `git fetch --all --prune`; if the worktree is clean and the current branch can fast-forward, run `git pull --ff-only`. If local changes, conflicts, missing upstream, or non-fast-forward history make that unsafe, do not stash/reset/overwrite local state; analyze against fetched remote refs or record the baseline gap before proceeding.
- PR titles should use `<type>: <change summary>` such as `fix: 修复大盘分析历史记录丢失`; use `fix`/`feat`/`refactor`/`docs`/`chore`/`test`/`ci` where possible, and avoid `[codex]`, `codex`, `autocode`, `copilot`, or other tool/agent source prefixes. Treat this as process guidance and do not use title format mismatches as a hard review blocker.
- Do not hardcode secrets, accounts, ports, model names, absolute environment-specific paths, or environment-specific branches.
- Reuse existing modules, configuration entrypoints, scripts, and tests instead of adding parallel implementations.
- For user-visible behavior changes, CLI/API changes, deployment changes, notification changes, or report-structure changes, update the relevant docs and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- In `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, the `[Unreleased]` section uses a **flat format**: one line per entry formatted as `- [type] description`, where type is one of `新功能`/`改进`/`修复`/`文档`/`测试`/`chore`. **Do not add `### category headers` inside `[Unreleased]`** to minimize merge conflicts in concurrent PRs. A maintainer will reorganize into the full categorized format at release time.
- Use `README.md` only for project positioning, high-level capabilities, quick start, main entrypoints, and sponsorship/cooperation information; avoid updating README unless the change is homepage-level.
- Put detailed module behavior, page interaction, topic configuration, troubleshooting, field contracts, implementation semantics, and edge cases in the appropriate `docs/*.md` file instead of README.
- When config semantics change, sync `.env.example` and assess impact on local runs, Docker, GitHub Actions, API, Web, and Desktop.

## Validation

- Backend changes: prefer `./scripts/ci_gate.sh`; at minimum run `python -m py_compile` on changed Python files and the closest deterministic tests.
- Web changes: run `cd apps/dsa-web && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run build`.
- Desktop changes: build web first, then desktop if feasible.
- Review work should prioritize CI evidence (`gh pr checks`, workflow logs) before re-running local validation.
- AI governance changes: run `python scripts/check_ai_assets.py`.

## AI Asset Governance

- `AGENTS.md` is the single source of truth for repository AI collaboration rules.
- `CLAUDE.md` must remain a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.
- Use `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` for path-specific guidance.
- Current repository collaboration skills live in `.claude/skills/`; keep them aligned with `AGENTS.md`.
